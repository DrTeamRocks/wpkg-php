     * file system.

     * Examples:
     *     <param name='wpkg_base' value='http://wpkg.mydomain.com' />

     * NOTE: If you would like to use the flat XML file instead of the web based

     * NOTE: It is deprecated now to use HTTP URL values in wpkg_base. Instead you
     *       might have a look at the [packages|hosts|profiles]_paths parameters.
     *       There you can specify even mixed paths using HTTP and file/directory
     *       references. If a valid path is specified in wpkg_base then relative
     *       paths in [packages|hosts|profiles]_paths are relative to wpkg_base.
     *       If wpkg_base refers to an HTTP URL it is ignored when
